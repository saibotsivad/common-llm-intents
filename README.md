# Common LLM Intents

This is meant to be used with [llm-intent-matcher](https://github.com/saibotsivad/llm-intent-matcher), it's really just my own personal collection of intents and prompts.

Instead of making GitHub Issues/PRs, I suggest you just fork this and make your own modifications.

## Install

I didn't bother publishing to npm, so you have to install from GitHub:

```bash
npm install saibotsivad/common-llm-intents
```

## Using

Just import the whole map like this:

```js
import { intents } from 'saibotsivad/common-llm-intents'
```
